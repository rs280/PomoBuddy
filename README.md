## Inspiration
Students and adults are having a hard time getting used to in person school and work. People are forgetting about work, because they do not have a screen in front of them giving them a to do list. Within one hour, people forget 50 percent of the information given to them. Students especially, are getting distracted while doing their homework. 57 percent of parents report their child is spending more hours on distractions during homework. All of this, has increased stress levels in our society. 

## What it does
PomoBuddy is a chrome extension that solves all these problems. It allows users to select work that they have to do and compiles it all into a to-do list. Before a work session, users are also prompted to select sites that cause them distractions while working. These sites will then be blocked by the extension, and the user will not be able to access them while working. PomoBuddy follows the pomodoro technique which gives users chunks of 25 minutes to work. After the 25 minutes, a 5 minute break will be given. After four of these cycles, a large 15-20 minute break is given. During breaks, all blocked sites will be accessible. 

## Challenges we ran into
Getting the Pomodoro timer to properly work
Using cookies instead of LocalStorage
Retrieving cookies the proper way
Alerting users their Pomodoro cycle was done
